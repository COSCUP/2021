We have promoted the language revitalization policy at the government, many of our ethnic groups gave efforts on passing our language and written records. We are pleased to see that the Seediq language is officially launched on Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nIn the “Project for Wikipedia Construction of Aboriginal Languages” undertaken by the Center for Aboriginal Studies of Chengchi University in 2015, a group of tribal elders who can speak and write Seediq attempted to promote our Seediq language to the international stage. However, due to the lack of organizational aid and human resources, the written articles are limited and precarious. Fortunately, in 2019, with the Seediq Language Promotion Organization, we have a fixed place to gather editors and discuss, we have funding for meal expenses that gave us strength. Our original ambition has returned.\r\n\r\nIn April 2020, the Seediq Language Promotion Organization saw that it is about time, and asked a tribe youth(Jiang Kaiwen Walis Huwac) who passed the advanced ethnic language certification to be the convener and launch a youth editorial team to attract more Seediq and Han youth to join the editing. The editing was divided into 3 categories, the entry was a co-editing with the tribe elders. We edit regularly at the classroom organized by Seediq Language Promotion Organization from 18:00 to 20:30 every Friday evening.\r\n\r\nIn March 2021, thanks to the efforts of everyone to write in the Seediq language and edit on the Wiki platform, the Seediq language was finally seen by the world. All Seediq is no doubt the happiest group of people! At the same time, this shows that the government's Language Restoration Policy has also worked.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we will continue to write and edit Wikipedia; we will also recruit more elders and young people to join the editing to maintain the Wikipedia that belongs to us."},"speakers":["BRCAAS","L8PG3F"],"speakerZhName":"","speakerEnName":"","speakerZhBio":"","speakerEnBio":"","speakerAvatar":"","tags":["Beginner"],"co_write":"https://hackmd.io/@coscup/r1Xy7pPA_/%2F%40coscup%2FBJD6zpvAO","qa":"https://app.sli.do/event/eqd7isfm","slide":null,"record":null},{"id":"MPBF7T","type":"vh7gry","room":"TR214","start":"2021-07-31T11:35:00+08:00","end":"2021-07-31T12:15:00+08:00","language":"漢語","zh":{"title":"三寶 GO - 不收費、不收個資、不告人的交通違規檢舉系統","description":"三寶 GO 是因筆者多年來對政府和民間檢舉系統的失望而產生的作品，是一個 PWA，技術基礎使用了 Ruby on Rails 和 React，由兩人團隊自 2019 以來淬鍊而成。\r\n\r\n本議程將介紹政府檢舉系統的現況與問題，以及揭露三寶 GO 的技術細節，包括軟體架構、設計巧思以及測試撰寫等。此外還有筆者在過程中學到的經驗，例如 ActionStorage 和 ActionMailbox 的使用與 bug。\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sanbao.icu/"},"en":{"title":"Sanbao GO, A Free Traffic Violation Reporting System that Concerns Privacy.","description":"Sanbao GO is a PWA powered by Ruby on Rails and React.

The HPCF operates the first national Hakka radio station in Taiwan. Since its launch on June 23, 2017, it has played more than 30,000 hours of Hakka program audio files. We share the sound memories from the land, and plan to build a Hakka sound bank that collects local stories, folk songs and proverbs, and try to create database and release these Hakka sound sources from ownership to the good public. The arousal of the public's attention and participation in such issues as the openness of Hakka materials and cross-domain collaboration, we have called for Hakka partners since Dec. in 2020, review and organize the first-hand and second-hand field data accumulated in the local area, and use the equipment by following user manual to form a new Hakka open community. The community has successively uploaded the historical data of Hakka voices on the Chinese Wiki platform. In the process, it was discovered that Hakka characters and pinyin such as First-person perspective vocabulary \"𠊎\" (it means \"I\" ) are displayed on cross-platform, \"I write down what I say”. The issue such as the development of the new generation Hakka cross-platform input method and phonetic system also need to be solved and valued urgently.\r\n\r\nFor the aspect of media democracy in digital communication field, we focus on the public function of communication, the facilitation of communication in Hakka, and the transparency and sharing of the information. Related issues are like: how to integrate huge amount of local historical and cultural resources, how to build digital database of collected documents, and even the challenge of Hakka language writing and pinyin system. For the latter, until now, we still cannot type and show the Hakka word ‘I’ on the mobile devices. We hope there will be a better cross-platform Hakka typing system for the public in the future.\r\n\r\nTherefore, through the interdisciplinary presentation this time, we look forward to letting open source community, COSCUP community, experts from industry, academia, and the government, and the general public be aware of the issues we mentioned. From this point forward, we can open up more opportunities and routes for further participation, discussion, communication and engagement. Together, we hope to increase the use of Hakka communication in daily digital life and provide better user experience.\r\n\r\nHakka is recognized as a national language of Taiwan (R.O.C) in the Hakka Basic Act. The Hakka Public Communication Foundation (HPCF), as a public service media, is dedicated to promote Hakka language and culture.

Do you feel annoyed because of the presence of the proxy? Did you spend a lot of time figuring out how to configure the proxy? If you have the issues above, I will introduce you to a project, which can let your program connect to the Internet without the need to change the proxy server and configure the proxy. This talk will explain how this project achieves the intention with OVS.\r\n\r\nNowadays, many companies have firewalls and proxies installed for network security reasons. The employee’s packets are examined in order to determine if each packet has potential threats and to check if the connected websites are secure. However, the employment of the proxy server introduces trouble to the employees. Because the user’s computer must have the proxy setting well configured. And the user has to dive into the software manual to find out the way to configure it. This workflow is always time-consuming and unproductive. Even worse, some programs do not even have a way to configure the proxy.\r\n\r\nOne solution for this is to use the transparent proxy, which will redirect the traffic to the proxy server. Users will not know the existence of the proxy server so users do not bother to configure it. Even though there’s already a solution, however, the IT departments of the companies are not necessarily using the transparent proxy. And that is hard to change in a short time.\r\n\r\nIs there a way that users do not have to configure the proxy while IT is not using a transparent proxy? The answer is yes. The solution is to make your normal proxy transparent by using OVS’s packet processing technology to redirect the packets and rewriting the requests. This talk will cover the adoption of the man in the middle (MITM) concept, using OVS to redirect the packet to the MITM, rewriting HTTP and HTTPS requests to the proxy server, the flow design of OVS, and how the packet redirection works."},"speakers":["QTSJ8H"],"speakerZhName":"","speakerEnName":"","speakerZhBio":"","speakerEnBio":"","speakerAvatar":"","tags":[],"co_write":"https://hackmd.io/@coscup/rymNETD0O/%2F%40coscup%2FH1kM4aw0u","qa":"https://app.sli.do/event/k0ahlmv8","slide":null,"record":null},{"id":"B8MM7N","type":"00xv3j","room":"TR409-1","start":"2021-07-31T11:20:00+08:00","end":"2021-07-31T11:40:00+08:00","language":"漢語","zh":{"title":"My Journey with Apache Ozone","description":"介紹 Apache software foundation 是怎麼樣的一個組織，分享參與開發過程中的心得，包含參與開源軟體時與其他開發者的互動，以及我覺得開發開源專案的有趣的部分與比較辛苦的地方。"},"en":{"title":"My Journey with Apache Ozone","description":"Introduce the Apache software foundation and share the experience of participating in the development process, including the interaction with other developers when participating in open source software, as well as the interesting and difficult parts of developing open source projects."},"speakers":["X7MPQY"],"speakerZhName":"","speakerEnName":"","speakerZhBio":"","speakerEnBio":"","speakerAvatar":"","tags":[],"co_write":"https://hackmd.io/@coscup/SyATmawRO/%2F%40coscup%2FHy0sQ6DAd","qa":"https://app.sli.do/event/vfyytdy9","slide":null,"record":null},{"id":"WYXPBE","type":"v1wfus","room":"TR313","start":"2021-07-31T14:00:00+08:00","end":"2021-07-31T14:30:00+08:00","language":"漢語","zh":{"title":"開源教育於教學現場之經驗","description":"近年來隨著資訊發展，不斷在推動非電資背景的學生學習 Coding 能力，但對於完全沒接觸過程式的初心者，要如何學習程式甚至是鼓勵學生使用開源軟體呢？　首要當然是提供友善的學習環境，但更重要的是要如何引導，並讓學生了解運算思維及開源是一種生活態度成為至關重要的議題，故需要將時事議題或社區所面臨的問題帶到課堂中進行批判思考，教學過程中要如何做好引導，就必須要有教材與工具作為輔助。\r\n本議程將介紹下列主題，並於經驗分享中介紹在創新教學場域所面臨的實際問題：\r\n1. 何謂運算思維及運算思維教學工具\r\n2. 導入問題導向學習 (Problem-Based Learning, PBL) 及翻轉教育 （註：SDGs 17 議題之發想）\r\n3. 教育現場可以使用的軟體\r\n4. 開放授權之教材資源分享\r\n5. 創新教學場域與教案撰寫： 五種開放 (開源軟體使用、開放資料串接、開放源碼、開放教室、開放講座)\r\n6. 許願池文化\r\n7. 期末小型黑客松"},"en":{"title":"Open source education in programming learning for university students program","description":"This agenda will introduce what is meant by computational thinking, open source teaching aids, and how to encourage students to use open source software.\r\nThe agenda will introduce the following topics and share experiences on the practical issues faced in the innovative teaching and learning field.\r\n1. what is computational thinking and computational thinking teaching tools\r\n2. introduction to problem-based learning (PBL) and flipped education\r\n3. software available in the education field\r\n4. sharing of open  licensed teaching resources\r\n5. innovative teaching and learning fields: using open source software, open data linking, open source, open classroom, and open lecture\r\n6. wishing pool culture\r\n7. final-term mini hackathon"},"speakers":["RTBZCK"],"speakerZhName":"","speakerEnName":"","speakerZhBio":"","speakerEnBio":"","speakerAvatar":"","tags":[],"co_write":"https://hackmd.io/@coscup/BJ35HavRu/%2F%40coscup%2FSyFYrTvRd","qa":"https://app.sli.do/event/67q2gu7l","slide":null,"record":null},{"id":"WQGA3C","type":"v0h30f","room":"TR413-1","start":"2021-07-31T10:00:00+08:00","end":"2021-07-31T10:50:00+08:00","language":"漢語","zh":{"title":"從 PCB 了解如何開始自己鍵盤","description":"How to start your first keyboard from PCB."},"en":{"title":"How to start your first keyboard from PCB.","description":"How to start your first keyboard from PCB."},"speakers":["RNGT9P"],"speakerZhName":"","speakerEnName":"","speakerZhBio":"","speakerEnBio":"","speakerAvatar":"","tags":[],"co_write":"https://hackmd.io/@coscup/rytqNaDCd/%2F%40coscup%2FH1x5VpDC_","qa":"https://app.sli.do/event/myduu6kn","slide":null,"record":null},{"id":"EU9W89","type":"rvoagr","room":"TR212","start":"2021-07-31T12:00:00+08:00","end":"2021-07-31T12:30:00+08:00","language":"漢語","zh":{"title":"Haskell，不年輕卻前衛的優雅程式語言","description":"\"沒人在用，全部都是函數，一堆遞迴，函數可以當參數傳遞，沒有變數，寫起來很奇怪，很多數學，太學術\"\r\n\r\n在我的過去經歷中，我對函數式程式語言的理解僅止於簡單的 LISP，我甚至不知道我寫的是哪一種 LISP，但對於他們卻存在著模糊的 \"想象\"。這些想象在我開始學習 Haskell 後慢慢消失，形成更爲具體的意向，成爲我設計程式時的幫手。\r\n\r\n在這個議程內，將和各位聊聊 Haskell 這門程式語言，爲什麼我覺得他值得被介紹，他有哪些流行語言中找不到的有趣設計，值得我們去比較/批判。議程中會簡單介紹語法，幾個好玩的 type class，parser combinator  等新鮮有用的東西。\r\n\r\n議程內容會著重在 \"功能\" 而非 \"原理/理論\" 上，因此即便你對於函數式程式語言沒有概念，也歡迎一起參予，一起討論！"},"en":{"title":"Haskell, the old yet avant-garde programing language","description":"\"no body use it, functions everywhere, a lot of recursions, passing function as value, no variable, strongly connected with math, too academic\"\r\n\r\nIn my past experience, my understanding of functional programing stops at the surface of simple LISP, I can't even remember which dialects I used to learn.
